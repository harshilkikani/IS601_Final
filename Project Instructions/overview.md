The User Management System Final Project: Your Epic Coding Adventure Awaits! 🎉✨🔥

1. Feature Implementation: Implement a brand new, mind-blowing feature and make your epic mark on the project, following best practices for coding, testing, and documentation like a true artisan. ✨🚀🎆

2. Include links to the closed issues for the 5 QA issues, 10 NEW tests, and 1 Feature you'll be graded on. Make sure your project successfully deploys to DockerHub and include a link to your Docker repository in the document - let your work speak for itself! 📄🔗💥

3. Commit History: Show off your consistent hard work through your commit history like a true coding warrior. Projects with less than 10 commits will get an automatic 0 - ouch! 😬⚠️ A significant part of your project's evaluation will be based on your use of issues, commits, and following a professional development process like a boss - prove your coding prowess! 💻🔄🔥

4. Deployability: Broken projects that don't deploy to Dockerhub or pass all the automated tests on GitHub actions will face point deductions - nobody likes a buggy app! 🐞☠️ Show the world your flawless coding skills!

Follow these steps to ensure a successful (and sane!) project outcome:

1. Select a Feature from features.md: Choose a feature from the provided list of additional improvements that sparks your interest and aligns with your goals like a laser beam. ✨⭐🎯 This is your chance to shine!

2. Quality Assurance (QA): Thoroughly test the system's major functionalities related to your chosen feature and identify at least 5 issues or bugs like a true detective. Create GitHub issues for each identified problem, providing detailed descriptions and steps to reproduce - the more detail, the merrier! 🔍🐞🕵️‍♀️ Leave no stone unturned!

3. Test Coverage Improvement: Review the existing test suite and identify gaps in test coverage like a pro. Create 10 additional tests to cover edge cases, error scenarios, and important functionalities related to your chosen feature. Focus on areas such as user registration, login, authorization, and database interactions. Simulate the setup of the system as the admin user, then creating users, and updating user accounts - leave no stone unturned, no bug left behind! ✅🧪🔍🔬 Become the master of testing!

4. New Feature Implementation: Implement your chosen feature, following the project's coding practices and architecture like a coding ninja. Write appropriate tests to ensure your new feature is functional and reliable like a rock. Document the new feature, including its usage, configuration, and any necessary migrations - future you will thank you profusely! 🚀✨📝👩‍💻⚡ Make your mark on this project!

5. Maintain a Working Main Branch: Throughout the project, ensure you always have a working main branch deploying to Docker like a well-oiled machine. This will prevent any last-minute headaches and ensure a smooth submission process - no tears allowed, only triumphs! 😊🚢⚓ Stay focused, stay victorious!
