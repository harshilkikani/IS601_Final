The User Management System is an incredible project that not only showcases the power of modern web development technologies but also serves as a comprehensive learning resource for students across various fields. By adhering to industry best practices, incorporating the principles of the 12-Factor App methodology, and embracing the Agile Manifesto, this project offers a realistic and immersive experience that prepares students for the challenges and demands of the professional world.

## üåê Embracing the 12-Factor App Methodology

The 12-Factor App methodology is a set of principles that guide the development of modern, scalable, and robust software applications. The User Management System embodies these principles, providing students with a deep understanding of how to build applications that are production-ready.

1. **Codebase**: The codebase is a single, centralized repository, making it easy for students to collaborate, contribute, and track changes.
2. **Dependencies**: Dependencies are explicitly declared and managed, ensuring reproducible builds and consistent deployments.
3. **Configuration**: Configuration settings are separated from the codebase, allowing for seamless environment-specific customizations.
4. **Backing Services**: The project demonstrates how to treat backing services, such as databases and email providers, as attached resources, promoting portability and scalability.
5. **Build, Release, Run**: The project follows a strict separation of build, release, and run stages, enabling continuous deployment and streamlined workflows.
6. **Processes**: The application is designed to run as one or more stateless processes, facilitating horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.
7. **Port Binding**: The project showcases how to expose services via port binding, enabling seamless integration with various hosting environments.
8. **Concurrency**: Asynchronous programming techniques are employed, ensuring efficient handling of concurrent requests and maximizing resource utilization.
9. **Disposability**: The application is designed to start up and shut down gracefully, enabling smooth deployments and facilitating resilience.
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: The project emphasizes the importance of maintaining consistency between development, staging, and production environments, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and bugs.
11. **Logs**: Logging is implemented as an event stream, providing valuable insights into the application's behavior and facilitating monitoring and troubleshooting.
12. **Admin Processes**: The project includes administrative processes, such as database migrations and user management, enabling seamless application lifecycles. - Needs a command line app...
